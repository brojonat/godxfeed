# godxlink

There's no Go client library for `dxlink` so I'm building this one.

Here's the reference repo: https://github.com/dxFeed/dxLink

This is still very much a work in progress, but I have used it to successfully stream real time equity symbol data to my frontend app. However, TastyWorks was still negotiating terms with DXLink for streaming options prices so I shelved this project. They have since made options prices available to their developers so I'll resume work on this soon.
